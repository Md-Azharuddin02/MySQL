Limit clause: it will provid a limit to a table that how much data it can show in one search.

select *from mytable limit 5;

Note : you give limit more than data than it will return all data from the table.

    Exp: if there are only 10 data into the table and you are giving limit 20. then i will return all 10 data from the datable.


Note : if you want to get only 3 data from the table and those data should start from 3 to 7 then we can use 
       ofset commnad

       select *from mytable limit 3 ofset 4;(here data will start from 5. like 5,6.7)


Note : we can also use where clause with limit clause.
        select *from mytable where name='prince' limit 5;
